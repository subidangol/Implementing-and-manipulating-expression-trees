# Implementing-and-manipulating-expression-trees
This program evaluates expressions and displays the result along with the expressions to the user. It displays the expressions in three forms, which are infix, prefix, and postfix expressions. This program implements the expression tree to evaluate the expressions. This tree is implement in a class and has class member functions that manipulate the tree. First, it reads the expressions from the file, them uses expression trees to solve them. After each expression, it evaluates the statement and goes to the next expression to evaluate. This program can ignore white spaces, but the file should exist and be in a readable format. 

Data Structure:  
This program uses nodes that have four parts: one stores the operand, one stores the operator, and the remaining two points to the left and right subtrees. It uses pointers that points to the nodes to implement a tree abstract data type. It also uses character variables and integer variables. The character variables are used to read the expressions one character at a time and evaluate its position in the tree. The integers are mainly used for storing the operands and the results of the operations. A string variable is used to store the file name given by the user. This program also uses “fstream” header to read the files.
